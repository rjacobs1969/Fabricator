Join the profiles with the corner brackets in such a way that the solid face of the corner brackets are in line with the short profiles, note not pictured are the recommended inner corner brackets as I added them at a later stage

Prepare the linear rails with t-blocks (t-nut can work too but I prefer the blocks)
I used a nut every third rail hole.

Adjust the height of the rail to start 6cm from the bottom, hint: you can use the 2060 profile to do so
